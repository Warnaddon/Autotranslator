AutoTranslator — LabyMod 4 Addon (Java 17)

AutoTranslator is a utility addon for LabyMod 4, built with Java 17, designed to help players understand chat messages written in foreign languages in real time. The addon is especially useful in international servers where players communicate in multiple languages.

Instead of interrupting gameplay or copying messages into external translators, AutoTranslator allows you to instantly view translated chat messages by hovering over them. This ensures a smooth, non-intrusive experience while keeping the original message intact.

The addon is intended as a translation aid, not a guaranteed perfect interpretation.

Delayed translations

Skipped translations during high chat volume

The addon is designed to minimize these issues, but they cannot be fully avoided due to third-party service limitations.
